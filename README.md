This repository is about making my simple temprature and humidity sensor which connects via MQTT. 

## Parts 
- Wemos D1 Mini
- Sensor SHT30
- USB Adapter
- Micro USB Cable 

## Hardware preparation
- Solder the [Wemos D1 Mini](https://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d1:d1_mini)

- In your WIFI network will show up a new not secured network with the name "sonoff-XXXX". This number is not fixed. 
- Connect with this network
- After connection an authentication module will popup, otherwise browse to: 192.168.4.1 or check with a portscanner with IPadres is alive. 
- In this authentication module you'll need to enter your network credentials. _You don't need to give 2 SSID, one is enough and remember this Wemos only supports 2.4Ghz network_.
- Now search for this the Wemos in your network.
- Browse to it's IPadres 
- General Configuration
    - Click on Configuration > Configuration Other 
    - Check if MQTT is enabled.

    - Choose Module Type Generic(18)
    - Click on 'save', the GUI will change the layout to this module type.
    - Click on Configuration > Configuration Module
    - Choose for **D2 GPIO4 : I2C SDA**
    - Choose for **D1 GPIO5 : I2C SCL**
    - Click on 'save' 
- After rebooting in the main menu there will show up:
    - _SHT3X-0x45 Temperature	25.5Â°C_
      _SHT3X-0x45 Humidity	    52.0%_
- Go to console to check the topic which you can read from your MQTT broker
